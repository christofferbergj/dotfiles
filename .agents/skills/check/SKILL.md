# Check: Review Before You Ship

Prefix your first line with 🥷 inline, not as its own paragraph.

> Note: `/review` is a built-in Anthropic plugin command for PR review. Waza uses `/check` (or the alias `code-review`) instead. Do not re-trigger `/review` from within this skill.

Read the diff, find the problems, fix what can be fixed safely, ask about the rest. Done means verification ran in this session and passed.

## Plan Execution Mode

Activate when the user's message starts with "Implement the following plan", "按计划实施", "按照计划", "整", "可以干", "直接改" followed by a plan body, or links to a `/think` output.

In this mode, do not run a code review. Instead:

1. State which plan is being executed (first heading or summary line).
2. Check for obvious repo drift: run `git status` and skim any changed files that contradict the plan. If drift makes the plan unsafe, name the specific conflict and stop.
3. Work through each plan item as a to-do. Mark each complete as you go.
4. After all items are done, run the project's verification command.
5. Transition automatically into Ship mode if the project context or current thread indicates review-then-ship.

## Default Continuation (review-then-ship)

When the project's `AGENTS.md` or the current thread explicitly asks to "commit after review", "ship if green", or equivalent, transition directly from review to the Ship flow after a clean review. Do not ask again. State "proceeding to ship" before acting.

## Project Context Extraction

This is Waza's public, standalone code-review capability. It should not depend on private machine paths or unpublished project instructions.

Before reviewing, extract project constraints from repository context:

1. Read the diff and identify changed languages, frameworks, manifests, generated outputs, release files, and CI workflows.
2. Inspect public project files only as needed: README, AGENTS/CLAUDE instructions when present, package manifests, lockfiles, build configs, test configs, workflow files, and release notes.
3. Compress the findings into review context: verification commands, protected or generated files, release artifacts, domain risks, and public reply rules.
4. Apply the stricter rule when project context and this skill overlap.
5. If project docs or CI name a verification command, prefer that over auto-detection.

For the context shape, see `references/project-context.md`.

For release or maintainer work, also fill the Release Gate 2.0 matrix from `references/project-context.md`. It covers review base, dirty/staged/untracked state, latest tag, origin sync, version fields, generated artifacts, package/archive contents, release assets, registry/appcast/CI, and public issue/PR state. Missing matrix evidence is a blocker for a "ready to release" claim.

## Durable Context Preflight

Run this only when the user mentions memory, preview, previous decisions, or a prior conclusion; when they provide a memory path; or when the current project exposes an obvious local memory summary. Do not hard-code machine-specific memory roots or read raw transcripts.

Read durable context in this order: user-provided path, current project scope, then global preferences. List titles first, then open at most 1-2 relevant summaries. Treat cross-project entries as transferable patterns only.

Map memory types before using them: `decision`, `preference`, and `principle` are private task constraints; `pattern` and `learning` are review checklists; `fact` must be verified against current state before it affects the review. Current code, diff, public docs, CI, tests, and remote state override memory.

For `/check`, durable memory can explain user intent and preferred follow-through, but public project rules still come from README files, manifests, CI workflows, release docs, the diff, and explicit instructions in the current thread. Never cite private memory as a public project requirement.

## Get the Diff

Get the full diff between the current branch and the base branch. If unclear, ask. If already on the base branch, ask which commits to review.

## Triage Mode

Activate when the user mentions: issue, PR, "review all", triage, "batch", or "批量处理". Skip the diff flow and run this instead.

**Action-first rule:** Items with a clear disposition (already fixed, duplicate, already released) get acted on immediately without analysis paragraphs. When analyzing screenshots or images, state what you see and the suggested action in one message. Only ask the user when the disposition is genuinely ambiguous.

**Flow:** Pull open items with `gh issue list -R <repo> --state open --limit 20` and `gh pr list -R <repo> --state open`. For each item, check if a fix already shipped: `git log --oneline <latest-tag>..HEAD | grep -i "<keyword>"`. If shipped: close with note. If merged but unreleased: reply "已修复，等下一个版本 release" and close. If no fix: analyze and act. Fix now if possible (`fix: closes #N` commit); for Mole nightly-fixed items reply `@<user>, this is already fixed in the latest nightly. Upgrade: mo update --nightly` and close; for valid-but-unreleased items acknowledge and leave open; for invalid items give one-two sentence reason and close.

Before final conclusions in a live queue, refresh the issue/PR list once more and re-read any item that changed during the run. If evidence is incomplete, hold the item instead of closing it on a guess.

**PR handling:** If the PR direction is accepted but the patch needs changes, prefer pushing the maintainer's fixes to the contributor's PR branch and then merging the PR. Check `maintainerCanModify` first. If branch edits are not allowed, ask the contributor to enable maintainer edits or push the needed revision; only fall back to a separate maintainer commit when timing or release safety requires it, and say so in the PR. Close without merging only when the direction is rejected, unsafe, no longer needed, or explicitly not part of the project's scope. Do not silently absorb an accepted PR into `main` and close it.

**Public reply shape (maintainer, issue or PR):**

1. Resolve `@<login>` from `gh issue view` / `gh pr view --json author`.
2. **Language:** Match the **opener's** language when it is Chinese or English. If the opener used Japanese or Korean, use English for the maintainer reply unless project docs override.
3. Open with `@<login>` and **at most one** short thanks (`感谢反馈`, `thank you for the report`, etc.). Do **not** add closing thanks stacks (`再次感谢`, `Thanks again`, long courtesy endings).
4. One or two short paragraphs: factual reason, what shipped or what is blocked, no ceremony.
5. Always give a **next step tied to releases or verification**: next App Store or GitHub release, nightly upgrade command, cache path to clear once, or exactly what info is still needed.
6. Prefer **editing** an existing maintainer comment (`PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}`) when updating wording; avoid delete plus repost unless the old text must disappear from history.

Default to this shape unless `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` in the repo contradicts it.

**Sign-off line (append to standard sign-off):**
```
triage:           N reviewed, N closed, N deferred
```

## Release Worthiness Analysis

Activate when the user asks "深入分析 X 是不是值得发新版本", "is this worth a new release", "值不值得发版", or similar.

1. Run `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline` (find last tag with `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1`).
2. Count and classify commits: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), chore/docs/refactor (internal).
3. Output:
   - **Commit summary**: N feat, N fix, N chore since last release
   - **Verdict**: release / skip (one line)
   - **Recommended version bump**: patch (fixes only), minor (feat present), major (breaking change)
   - **Key risk**: one sentence on the biggest risk in this batch
4. If verdict is "release", offer to transition into Ship mode.

## Ship / Release Follow-through

Activate when the user asks to commit, tag, release, publish, push, reply on an issue/PR, or close an issue after a change is ready.

This mode extends review; it does not skip review. Before any public or irreversible action:

1. Extract release rules from public project context: README, manifests, CI workflows, release notes, package scripts, changelogs, and explicit user instructions in the current thread.
2. Fill the Release Gate 2.0 matrix from `references/project-context.md`: review base, dirty/staged/untracked state, latest tag, origin sync, version fields, generated artifacts, package/archive contents, release assets, registry/appcast/CI, and public issue/PR state.
3. Verify generated or bundled outputs, version fields, release notes, package contents, and required artifacts are in sync. Prefer dry-run commands when the ecosystem provides them.
4. Commit only intended files. Preserve unrelated dirty work, and serialize git operations so index locks or overlapping adds do not corrupt the workflow.
5. Push, publish, tag, or create a release only when the user has explicitly approved that action. If auth, OTP, CI, registry, or network state blocks the operation, pause and report the exact blocker.
6. For issue/PR follow-through, confirm the item identity with `gh issue view` or `gh pr view` before posting. Use the **Public reply shape** from Triage Mode (mention, single thanks, facts, explicit next release or verification step). Close only when the fix is shipped, already available, invalid, duplicate, or the maintainer explicitly asked for closure.
7. For GitHub release reaction follow-through, only do it when project context or the current thread asks for it. After the release exists and required assets are verified, resolve the release id from the tag, POST every positive release reaction to `repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/<id>/reactions` with `gh api`, and re-read reactions to confirm. Positive release reactions are `+1`, `laugh`, `heart`, `hooray`, `rocket`, and `eyes`.
8. After network or API failures, re-read the end state instead of assuming success or failure.

End with the concrete shipped state: commit hash, tag, release URL, registry/version result, pushed branch, release asset state, release reaction state, issue/PR state, and any remaining blockers. Omit fields that do not apply.

## Scope

Measure the diff and classify depth:

| Depth | Criteria | Reviewers |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Quick** | Under 100 lines, 1-5 files | Base review only |
| **Standard** | 100-500 lines, or 6-10 files | Base + conditional specialists |
| **Deep** | 500+ lines, 10+ files, or touches auth/payments/data mutation | Base + all specialists + adversarial pass |

State the depth before proceeding.

## Did We Build What Was Asked?

Before reading code, check scope drift: do the diff and the stated goal match? Label: **on target** / **drift** / **incomplete**.

Drift signals (examples, not exhaustive -- any one is enough to label drift):
- A changed file has no connection to the stated goal
- The diff includes pure refactoring (renames, formatting, restructuring) when the goal was a bug fix or feature
- A new dependency appears that the goal did not mention
- Code unrelated to the goal was deleted or commented out
- A new abstraction or helper was introduced that is not required by the goal

## Hard Stops (fix before merging)

Examples, not exhaustive -- flag any diff that could cause irreversible harm if merged unreviewed.

- **No unverified claims.** Do not write "I verified X", "I ran Y", "tests pass", or "this fixes Z" unless the shell output is in this turn's transcript. If you reason about behavior without running, say "based on reading the code" instead of "I verified". Every verification claim in the sign-off must point to a command that actually ran in this session.
- **Destructive auto-execution**: any task marked "safe" or "auto-run" that modifies user-visible state (history files, config, preferences, installed software) must require explicit confirmation.
- **Release artifacts missing**: verify every artifact listed in release notes, release templates, or project workflows exists and has been uploaded before declaring done.
- **Generated artifact drift**: if source changes require generated or bundled outputs, verify the output was regenerated and included.
- **Version skew**: release version fields across manifests, package metadata, app configs, changelogs, tags, or lockfiles must stay synchronized.
- **Unknown identifiers in diff**: any function, variable, or type introduced in the diff that does not exist in the codebase is a hard stop. Grep before writing or approving any reference: `grep -r "name" .` -- no results outside the diff = does not exist.
- **Injection and validation**: SQL, command, path injection at system entry points. Credentials hardcoded, logged, committed, or copied into public docs.
- **Dependency changes**: unexpected additions or version bumps in package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt. Flag any new dependency not obviously required by the diff.
- **Safety sinks**: destructive file operations, shell or AppleScript construction, cwd/path/symlink traversal, approval or sandbox boundary changes, signing/appcast flows, and auth prompts need explicit review of validation, rollback, and user-confirmation behavior.

## Knowledge Sync

After reviewing the diff, check whether it introduces invariants not yet captured in project docs:

- New safety gate or path-guard rule → AGENTS.md
- New UI constraint (layout rule, animation, overlay registration) → `.claude/rules/*.md`
- New deploy/release step or artifact → AGENTS.md or `docs/`
- New cross-file sync requirement (enum ↔ HTML anchors, Swift keys ↔ xcstrings) → AGENTS.md

If found, either apply the doc update as `safe_auto` (when the invariant is clear from the diff) or flag it in the sign-off as `doc debt`. When no new invariants exist, sign-off says `doc debt: none`.

## Specialist Review (Standard and Deep only)

Load `references/persona-catalog.md` to determine which specialists activate. Launch all activated specialists in parallel via the environment's agent or sub-agent facility when available, passing the full diff. If no parallel reviewer facility exists, run the specialist passes sequentially in the same session.

Merge findings: when two specialists flag the same code location, keep the higher severity and note cross-reviewer agreement. Findings on different code locations are never duplicates even if they share a theme.

## Autofix Routing

| Class | Definition | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| `safe_auto` | Unambiguous, risk-free: typos, missing imports, style inconsistencies | Apply immediately |
| `gated_auto` | Likely correct but changes behavior: null checks, error handling additions | Batch into one user confirmation block |
| `manual` | Requires judgment: architecture, behavior changes, security tradeoffs | Present in sign-off |
| `advisory` | Informational only | Note in sign-off |

Apply all `safe_auto` fixes first. Batch all `gated_auto` into one confirmation block. Never ask separately about each one.

## Adversarial Pass (Deep only)

"If I were trying to break this system through this specific diff, what would I exploit?" Four angles (see `references/persona-catalog.md`): assumption violation, composition failures, cascade construction, abuse cases. Suppress findings below 0.60 confidence.

## GitHub Operations

Use `gh` CLI for all GitHub interactions, not MCP or raw API. Confirm CI passes before merging.

## Verification

Run `bash scripts/run-tests.sh` from this skill directory, or the project's known verification command from the target repository. Paste the full output.

If the script exits non-zero or prints `(no test command detected)`: halt. Do not claim done. Ask the user for the verification command before proceeding. If the user also cannot provide one, document this explicitly in the sign-off as `verification: none -- no command available` and flag it as a structural gap, not a pass.

For bug fixes: a regression test that fails on the old code must exist before the fix is done.

## Gotchas

| What happened | Rule |
|---------------|------|
| Commented on #249 when discussing #255 | Run `gh issue view N` to confirm title before acting |
| PR comment sounded like a report | 1-2 sentences, natural, like a colleague. Not structured, not AI-sounding. |
| PR comment used bullet points | Write as short paragraphs, one thought per paragraph; thank the contributor first |
| article.en.md inside _posts_en/ doubled the suffix | Check naming convention of existing files in the target directory first |
| Deployed without env vars set | Run `vercel env ls` before deploying; diff against local keys |
| Push failed from auth mismatch | Run `git remote -v` before the first push in a new project |

## Document Review

For document, PDF, white paper, or prose review, route to `/write` (Document Review Mode). `/check` handles code diffs and release artifacts only.
