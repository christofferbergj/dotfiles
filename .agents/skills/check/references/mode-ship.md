# Release Worthiness And Ship Follow-through

Loaded from `check` Mode Picker for "is this worth a release" and for commit / push / publish / tag / issue-closure follow-through. Ship extends review; it does not replace it.

## Release Worthiness Analysis

Activate when the user asks "深入分析 X 是不是值得发新版本", "is this worth a new release", "值不值得发版", or similar.

Classify every commit since the last published tag (the tag is the baseline, not a local VERSION file), then output:

- **Commit summary**: N feat, N fix, N chore since last release
- **Verdict**: release / skip (one line)
- **Recommended version bump**: patch (fixes only), minor (feat present), major (breaking change)
- **Key risk**: one sentence on the biggest risk in this batch

If the verdict is "release", offer to transition into Ship mode.

## Ship / Release Follow-through

Activate when the user asks to commit, tag, release, publish, push, reply on an issue/PR, or close an issue after a change is ready.

This mode extends review; it does not skip review. Before any public or irreversible action:

1. Extract release rules from public project context: README, manifests, CI workflows, release notes, package scripts, changelogs, and explicit user instructions in the current thread.
2. Fill the Release Gate 2.0 matrix from `references/project-context.md`. Seed the deterministic rows with `python3 <skill-base-dir>/scripts/release_gate.py --root <project>` (worktree state, remote sync, tag baseline, version field sync, changelog mention) and paste its status lines as evidence; the remaining rows (generated artifacts, package/archive contents, release assets, registry/appcast/CI, public issue/PR state) stay judgment calls with their own evidence.
3. Verify generated or bundled outputs, version fields, release notes, package contents, and required artifacts are in sync. Prefer dry-run commands when the ecosystem provides them. When drafting release notes or update-feed copy, follow `/write` and its release-note mode; for Chinese copy, load its zh release-notes rules before the first draft, not after a tone complaint -- translation-flavored Chinese notes are a defect, not a polish item.
   Before drafting release notes, read the repo's previous published release (`gh release view` the latest tag) and treat its title convention, item count, per-item length, and language layout as the hard template; replace content only, never invent a new format.
   Generated deliverables include tracked archives, ignored dist files, appcasts, site/download copy, registry packages, checksums, and release assets. If project docs require them, regenerate, inspect, and stage or upload them explicitly even when they are ignored by git; do not infer readiness from source-only tests. For remote assets, prefer downloading or reading back the published artifact and comparing entries, checksums, or manifest contents; release page text, file size, or workflow success alone is not artifact proof.
   If the project has preview, beta, nightly, stable, or App Store lanes, name the lane explicitly. Do not use a preview or beta artifact to claim stable release readiness, and do not touch stable appcast, registry, or download surfaces when the requested lane is preview-only unless project docs require it.
   Classify each change by deployment surface before concluding what is live: code that ships inside a packaged artifact (app binary, bundled CLI, release archive) reaches users only at the next release, while sites, serverless functions, CDN config, and infrastructure deploy automatically when the default branch updates. One batch of changes can be unreleased on the first surface and already in production on the second; state each surface separately instead of letting "not released yet" cover auto-deployed code.
4. Commit only intended files. Preserve unrelated dirty work, serialize git operations so index locks or overlapping adds do not corrupt the workflow, and re-check HEAD/status before pushing so concurrent agent or maintainer commits are not swept into your ship action.
5. Push, publish, tag, or create a release only when the user has explicitly approved that action. If auth, OTP, CI, registry, or network state blocks the operation, pause and report the exact blocker.
6. For issue/PR follow-through, confirm the item identity with the host's read command before posting. On GitHub, use `gh issue view` or `gh pr view`; on other hosts, use the CLI/API named by project docs or the current request. Use `references/public-reply.md` for the maintainer reply template (mention, single thanks, facts, explicit next release or verification step) and its closure criteria.
7. For GitHub release reaction follow-through, only do it when project context or the current thread asks for it. After the release exists and required assets are verified, resolve the release id from the tag, POST every positive release reaction to `repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/<id>/reactions` with `gh api` or the available GitHub tool, and re-read reactions to confirm. Positive release reactions are `+1`, `laugh`, `heart`, `hooray`, `rocket`, and `eyes`.
8. After network or API failures, re-read the end state instead of assuming success or failure.

### Reworked Or Cancelled Release Gate

Activate this gate when a release candidate was cancelled, a preview or beta had repeated bug-fix churn, or the user asks whether a delayed release is finally safe. Load `references/release-surfaces.md` (Reworked Or Cancelled Release Gate): review from the last public stable tag through `HEAD` by shipped risk surface, and output two decisions, whether the preview keeps taking user testing and whether stable release prep can start.

Lead the verdict with an explicit go / no-go (ship, or the named blockers), then the concrete shipped state: commit hash, tag, release URL, registry/version result, pushed branch, release asset state, release reaction state, issue/PR state, and any remaining blockers. Omit fields that do not apply.
