# Project Review Context Template

Use this template to compress repository context before running Waza `/check`. The context must come from public project files, the diff, CI configuration, or explicit user instructions. Do not depend on private machine paths or unpublished project instructions.

## What Belongs In Waza `/check`

- Diff depth classification.
- Scope drift detection.
- Hard stops such as destructive automation, missing release artifacts, generated artifact drift, version skew, unknown identifiers, injection risks, credential leakage, and dependency surprises.
- Release Gate 2.0 matrix for release readiness.
- Safety sink review for destructive operations, command construction, path boundaries, signing/appcast, sandbox/approval, and auth prompts.
- Security and architecture specialist routing.
- Autofix policy.
- Sign-off format.
- Verification expectations.

## What Belongs In Project Context

- Verification commands discovered from public docs, manifests, Makefiles, scripts, or CI workflows.
- Protected files and directories.
- Generated or bundled artifacts that must stay in sync with source changes.
- Packaging source of truth: whether archives are built from `git ls-files`, explicit allowlists, generated manifests, or source directories.
- Delivery surfaces: whether generated outputs are tracked, ignored, external release assets, registry uploads, appcasts, installer metadata, checksums, or site/download copy; how they are regenerated, inspected, staged, or uploaded.
- Distribution lanes: preview, beta, nightly, stable, App Store, or registry channels, and which generated artifacts belong to each lane.
- CLI command surfaces: entrypoints, subcommands, flags, help/version behavior, exit codes, stdout/stderr contract, TTY and non-interactive paths, config/env precedence, and installed-runtime checks.
- Runtime dependencies introduced by the diff: Python packages, CLIs, network services, package managers, or platform tools that are not already declared in CI/docs.
- Skill, plugin, marketplace, or package install surfaces: installer default ref, marketplace source path, generated mirror, package allowlist, archive root, executable bits, and the installed-runtime smoke command.
- Domain-specific safety rules.
- Release artifacts that must exist.
- GitHub release reactions or other public release follow-through expected by the project.
- Release-asset verification method: download, archive entry comparison, checksum manifest, package metadata readback, appcast readback, or registry query.
- Public issue or PR reply conventions.
- Known CI or test flakes documented by the project and how to distinguish them from real failures.
- Release, publish, push, or issue-closure prerequisites documented by the project.

## What Does Not Belong In Public Context

- Credential paths, private key filenames, passwords, tokens, or secret values.
- Maintainer-only machine paths.
- One-off personal preferences that do not affect project behavior.
- One-off review reports, scorecards, or diagnostic snapshots copied as guidance instead of distilled into stable project rules.
- Raw memory, chat excerpts, screenshots, private support details, local paths, project-specific commands, issue/PR numbers, release tags, or commit hashes from another project.
- Full copies of Waza `/check` sections.

## Recommended Context Shape

```markdown
## Project Commands

- Format: `<command>`
- Fast check: `<command>`
- Full verification: `<command>`

## CLI Command Surface

- Entrypoints: `<command or bin>`.
- Command contract: help/version, subcommands, flags, exit codes, stdout/stderr, JSON/schema output.
- Runtime shape: TTY vs non-interactive behavior, env/config precedence, completion/manpage or shell integration.
- Install/run proof: built package, temp prefix, PATH shim, shebang/executable bit, or package-manager path checked with `<command>`.
- Mutating commands: dry-run/confirmation, operation log, rollback/retry behavior, signal/partial-failure handling.

## Skill Or Plugin Install Surface

- User install path: `<package manager / release archive / marketplace entry / plugin id / installer script>`.
- Source path and generated mirror: `<source dir>` -> `<installed dir>`.
- Package/archive inclusion: new scripts, references, templates, rules, manifests, and executable bits checked with `<command>`.
- Isolated install smoke: fresh temp home/config/cache plus `<install command>` and `<list or invoke command>`.
- Noise filtering: cache files, local logs, screenshots, and temp outputs excluded or intentionally shipped.

## Project Hard Stops

- Do not modify `<protected path>` unless explicitly requested.
- If `<artifact>` is generated from `<source>`, verify it was regenerated.
- If `<artifact>` is ignored by git but required for release, verify the regeneration and force-stage, upload, or registry publish path named by the project.
- If `<package script>` builds from tracked files or an allowlist, verify newly introduced helpers, references, templates, and scripts are included in `<archive>`.
- If an installer fetches remote content, verify the default ref is pinned to a release tag or checksum-protected; floating `main` must be an explicit override.
- If a helper introduces a non-stdlib package or external CLI, verify CI installs it or the helper fails with a clear setup path.
- If `<artifact>` is listed in release notes, verify it exists before sign-off.

## Project-Specific Risks

- `<risk>`: `<how to inspect it>`

## Public Replies

See `public-reply.md` for the full reply template (language match, `@user` + thanks, factual paragraphs, ship-state line, closure criteria). It is the single source; do not restate the rules here.

## Release Follow-through

- Version fields to check: `<manifest>`, `<app config>`, `<lockfile>`.
- Generated artifacts to check: `<artifact>` from `<source>`.
- Distribution lane: `<preview/beta/nightly/stable/etc.>` and which public surfaces it is allowed to touch.
- Dry-run command before publishing: `<command>`.
- Remote asset proof: `<download/readback command>` that checks content, manifest, digest, appcast, or registry state.
- GitHub release reactions to add after asset verification: `<+1/laugh/heart/hooray/rocket/eyes or none>`.
- Public state to re-read after publishing or closing: `<registry/release/issue URL or command>`.
```

Keep this context brief. It should guide the review, not replace the review method.

## Release Gate 2.0 Matrix

Fill this before claiming a change is release-ready. Use "n/a" only when the project clearly has no such surface.

| Surface | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Review base | Base branch, latest tag, and commit range reviewed |
| Worktree state | Dirty, staged, and untracked files accounted for |
| Remote state | `origin/main` or release branch sync checked |
| Version fields | Manifest, app config, changelog, appcast, and lockfile versions aligned |
| Distribution lane | Preview, beta, nightly, stable, registry, or app-store lane named, with unrelated lanes left untouched |
| Runtime dependencies | Newly introduced Python packages, CLIs, package managers, and network tools declared and available in CI |
| Generated artifacts | Tracked archives, ignored dist outputs, bundled/minified files, appcasts, installer metadata, checksums, and site/download copy regenerated or proven not needed |
| Package/archive contents | Built package inspected for required files, newly introduced helpers/references, and missing extras |
| Installed runtime | Package, skill, plugin, CLI, or marketplace install exercised from a clean environment when the diff changes installable surfaces |
| Release assets | GitHub release, appcast, download archive, checksum, or installer assets downloaded or read back and verified beyond page text or file size |
| Registry/appcast | npm/crates/Homebrew/appcast/App Store or equivalent state re-read after publish |
| CI status | Latest required checks passed or blocker named |
| Issue/PR state | Target issue or PR re-read before commenting, closing, merging, or saying shipped |

## Safety Sink Review

Any diff that touches one of these sinks needs explicit validation and rollback thinking:

- Deleting, moving, or overwriting user files, caches, history, preferences, or generated outputs.
- Building shell, AppleScript, SQL, URL, or filesystem paths from user input.
- Changing cwd handling, symlink resolution, path traversal guards, sandbox permissions, approval checks, or auth prompts.
- Changing signing, notarization, appcast, update, license, payment, or release asset generation.

Review the smallest entry point that reaches the sink, then the downstream call. If validation is missing or rollback is unclear, treat it as a hard stop.
