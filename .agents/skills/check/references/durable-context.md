# Durable Context Preflight

Shared preamble for every skill that reads optional memory or prior-decision context. Each `SKILL.md` links to this file and then adds skill-specific guidance.

## Scope

Read durable context when the user names memory, a prior decision, or a memory path, or when the project exposes an obvious local memory summary (a `MEMORY.md` or a documented memory directory). List titles first and open at most one or two summaries; do not hard-code machine-specific memory roots, and do not read raw transcripts. Treat cross-project entries as transferable patterns, not as facts about this project.

## Current state wins

Current code, diff, screenshots, logs, tests, docs, CI, remote state, and live probes always override memory, including memory the runtime injects on its own. A remembered fact is a lead to re-verify, never evidence. When current state conflicts with a remembered claim, name the conflict and follow current state.

## Redaction gate

When turning prior chats, durable memory, or cross-project notes into reusable Waza guidance, promote only workflow rules. Strip raw transcript text, screenshots, local paths, project-specific commands, issue or PR numbers, release tags, commit hashes, private product boundaries, paid or license details, support routing, user names, and one-machine state.

If an example is necessary, use neutral placeholders such as `ExampleCLI`, `ExampleApp`, `<issue>`, `<release>`, or `<command>`. Do not copy a private answer, maintainer reply, screenshot observation, or project-specific incident as a durable rule.

Each skill adds its own paragraph below this reference for skill-specific overrides and constraints.
