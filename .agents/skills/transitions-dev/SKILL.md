# Transitions.dev

Twenty-one portable CSS transitions, each namespaced under `t-*` selectors with semantic CSS custom properties. Drop-in: paste the snippet, wire the documented HTML hooks, done. No framework dependencies, no demo-specific markup, and every snippet ships a `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.

## Decision rules

When the user asks for a transition, match against the visible UI element first, then the verb:

- **Trigger + small dot floating on top** → notification badge.
- **Trigger + surface that grows from it** → dropdown (anchored, origin-aware) or modal (centered, no anchor).
- **Surface that slides into a region of the page** → panel reveal.
- **Two screens, list ↔ detail or step 1 ↔ step 2** → page side-by-side.
- **Element changes width or height** → card resize.
- **Element's text content changes in place** → text states swap.
- **Two icons in the same slot** → icon swap.
- **A number updates** → number pop-in.
- **Confirmation / success / "done" moment** (checkmark, payment processed, file uploaded) → success check.
- **Hovering an item in a horizontal stack** (avatars, chips, segmented buttons, tag pills) → avatar group hover.
- **Form validation error / "this is wrong" feedback** (invalid field, wrong PIN, duplicate name) → error state shake.
- **Clearing a text field** (search box × button, filter reset) → input clear with dissolve.
- **Placeholder that loads then swaps to real content** (list row, card, profile header) → skeleton loader and reveal.
- **In-progress / "thinking" text that should feel alive** (loading label, streaming status) → shimmer text.
- **Small horizontal set of mutually-exclusive options with a moving highlight** (view switcher, segmented control, filter tabs) → tabs sliding.
- **Hover/focus hint that appears over a trigger** (icon tooltip, info bubble) → tooltip open / close.
- **Stacked headline + supporting line entering with rhythm** (hero copy, empty state, onboarding step) → texts reveal.
- **Card / tile that should react in 3D to the pointer on hover** (product card, cover art, membership card, with or without a light glare) → card hover tilt.
- **Circular trigger that becomes the surface it opens** (+ FAB grows into a menu / panel, compose button expands) → plus → menu morph. If the surface is a *separate* popover that merely grows from the trigger, use menu dropdown instead.
- **Header with a collapsible body that grows / shrinks in height** (settings group, FAQ, filter section, "show more", disclosure) → accordion expand.
- **No clear match** → fall back to `transitions reveal` and let the user pick. Don't guess.

If two transitions could fit, prefer the lower-overhead one (card resize over panel reveal, dropdown over modal, success check over a full modal celebration) unless the design clearly calls for the heavier surface. The success check is animation-only — if you also need to swap from a spinner to the check, pair it with **icon swap**.

## Commands

The skill exposes four namespaced verbs the agent should recognise in addition to direct transition requests. Every command starts with `transitions` so the invocation never collides with verbs from other skills installed in the same project.

### transitions reveal — list every transition

**Trigger phrases:** `transitions reveal`, "reveal the transitions", "list all transitions", "what transitions are in this skill", "show the transitions catalog".

**Behaviour:** print the twenty-one transitions as a numbered plain-text list — name, one-line summary, and the matching reference filename. Reuse the rows in `## Quick reference` above; do not invent new copy. No project access.

### transitions review — audit the project for fit

**Trigger phrases:** `transitions review`, "review my project", "audit my animations", "where would transitions.dev help", "find places to use this skill".

**Behaviour:**

1. Search the workspace for indicators: `transition:` declarations, `@keyframes`, hardcoded `ms` / `s` durations in style files, components matching the decision-rule patterns (modals, dropdowns, badges, search inputs, skeletons, tabs, tooltips, …).
2. For each hit, match against the decision rules and pick the single best-fit transition.
3. Output a numbered list grouped by file:
   - `path/to/Component.tsx:L42` — looks like a dropdown opening, suggest **menu-dropdown** (`05-menu-dropdown.md`).
   - Skip ad-hoc transitions that already use a `t-*` class.
4. Do not edit anything. End with: "Run `transitions apply` on any line to install the suggested transition."

### transitions apply — install the best-fit transition

**Trigger phrases:** `transitions apply`, "apply a transition here", "add the right transition", "install transitions-dev here", "fix the animation on this element".

**Behaviour:**

1. Read context: the currently-open file, the element nearest the cursor, surrounding CSS / JSX. If the user named a transition explicitly (e.g. `transitions apply menu-dropdown`), use it.
2. Run the decision rules from `## Decision rules` on that context and pick **one** transition. If two could fit, prefer the lower-overhead one (same tie-breaker the existing rules use).
3. Surface a one-line proposal: "I'd apply **menu-dropdown** here because the element opens from a trigger and is anchored. Confirm to install?".
4. On confirmation, follow the existing five-step procedure in `## Output format` verbatim (root block, snippet, hooks, reduced-motion guard, JS orchestration if needed).
5. If the agent can't pick a single transition with confidence, fall back to `transitions reveal` and ask the user to choose.

### transitions refine — replace ad-hoc motion with the motion tokens

**Trigger phrases:** `transitions refine`, "refine my transitions", "scan for ad-hoc transitions", "replace hardcoded durations with motion tokens", "tokenize my animations", "tune the durations / easing", "audit my custom keyframes", "make the timing consistent", "align to the motion tokens".

**Behaviour:**

1. **Scan the whole project** (not just dedicated stylesheets — also inline `style=` / CSS-in-JS, styled-components, `<style>` blocks, Tailwind arbitrary values like `duration-[300ms]`) for ad-hoc motion: `transition` / `animation` shorthands and longhands, custom `@keyframes` blocks, hardcoded durations (`…ms` / `…s`), easing (`cubic-bezier(...)` or keywords), translate distances (`px`), `scale(...)`, and `blur(...)`.
2. For each value, infer **what the motion does** (modal close, dropdown open, tooltip, badge appear, text reveal, page slide, shake, …) from the surrounding selectors / component plus the `## Decision rules`. For a `@keyframes` block, read the `animation` that drives it and judge the keyframes' own duration/easing.
3. **The key decision point is usage, not the raw number.** Look the inferred usage up in `## Motion tokens` and suggest the token whose documented usage matches — only when the usages line up. A 300ms modal close maps to `--duration-quick` because both are "modal close", even though the numbers differ. If a value's usage matches **no** token's usage, list it as `no matching token usage` and leave it untouched — never force a swap just because a number is close.
4. Output a numbered list grouped by file, showing only values that should change, each as `path/to/Component.css:L42` — `modal close: 300ms → var(--duration-quick) (150ms)`, `ease → var(--ease-smooth-out)`. For keyframe-driven motion, suggest the token for the driving `animation`'s duration/easing.
5. Do not edit anything. End with: "Confirm any line to apply the change, or run `transitions apply` to install a full transition instead."

## Motion tokens

The shared motion scale behind the twenty-one transitions — the same tokens the [transitions.dev](https://transitions.dev) Motion tokens tab exposes. They ship at the top of [`_root.css`](./_root.css), so once it's imported you can reference any of them as `var(--…)` (e.g. `transition: transform var(--duration-fast) var(--ease-smooth-out)`).

`transitions refine` maps each existing value to a usage below, then suggests the token to reference. Match on **usage**, not on the raw number — a 300ms modal close still maps to `--duration-quick` (150ms).

**Durations**

| Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--duration-stagger` | `40ms` | per-item stagger offset |
| `--duration-micro` | `80ms` | tooltip/path delay, shake segment, large stagger |
| `--duration-quick` | `150ms` | modal/dropdown close, text swap, tooltip appear |
| `--duration-fast` | `250ms` | icon swap, dropdown/modal open, tabs sliding, page slide |
| `--duration-medium` | `350ms` | panel close, toast close |
| `--duration-slow` | `400ms` | panel open, skeleton content reveal, input clear |
| `--duration-very-slow` | `500ms` | emphasis moments, badge appear, text reveal, success check |

**Easings**

| Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--ease-smooth-out` | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` | modal/dropdown/panel open + close, page slide, resize, position change |
| `--ease-in-out` | `ease-in-out` | icon swap, text swap, text reveal, skeleton reveal |
| `--ease-out` | `ease-out` | tooltip open / close |
| `--ease-linear` | `linear` | shimmer, skeleton pulse, spinner |
| `--ease-bounce` | `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.36, 0.64, 1)` | badge pop open |
| `--ease-bounce-strong` | `cubic-bezier(0.34, 3.85, 0.64, 1)` | bouncy hover-out (avatar return) |

**Distances**

| Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--distance-micro` | `4px` | text swap |
| `--distance-small` | `6px` | error shake (small segment) |
| `--distance-base` | `8px` | badge diagonal reveal, page slide, error shake (large segment) |
| `--distance-medium` | `12px` | text reveal |
| `--distance-large` | `30px` | check badge appear |

**Scales**

| Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--scale-large` | `0.96` | modal open / close |
| `--scale-medium` | `0.97` | dropdown open |
| `--scale-small` | `0.98` | tooltip open |
| `--scale-tiny` | `0.99` | dropdown close |

**Blur**

| Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--blur-small` | `2px` | panel reveal, icon swap, text swap, skeleton reveal, number pop-in |
| `--blur-medium` | `3px` | page slide, text reveal |
| `--blur-large` | `8px` | success check open |

## Universal install

Copy [`_root.css`](./_root.css) into your project **once** and import it (or paste its `:root` block into your global stylesheet). It leads with the shared **motion-token scale** (`--duration-*`, `--ease-*`, `--distance-*`, `--scale-*`, `--blur-*` — see `## Motion tokens`), followed by the semantic tunable variables for **all twenty-one** transitions. Every snippet reads from these names — `--resize-*`, `--badge-*`, `--dropdown-*`, `--clear-*`, `--shimmer-*`, `--tabs-*`, `--tt-*`, `--stagger-*`, `--tilt-*`, `--morph-*`, `--acc-*`, and the rest.

Each reference file also restates just the variables that snippet needs, so you can install a single transition without pulling the whole block. Don't duplicate the block — if `_root.css` is already imported, skip re-pasting any per-snippet `:root`.

The `--pX-*` source tokens used by the live demo at [transitions.dev](https://transitions.dev) are intentionally **not** exported. Tunable values are renamed to semantic names so the user owns the design vocabulary. A few transitions (input clear, shimmer text, tabs, tooltip) carry **color** tokens that differ by theme — each reference file documents the `html[data-theme="dark"]` overrides.

## Output format

When inserting a transition into the user's project:

1. **Install the variables from `_root.css`** into the user's global stylesheet, but only if they aren't already there — or just the per-snippet `:root` block from the reference file if installing a single transition. If the universal block is already imported, do **not** duplicate it.
2. **Paste the chosen transition's CSS verbatim** from the relevant reference file. Do not rewrite selectors, do not collapse the transition into shorthand, do not strip `will-change`. The snippets are tuned and tested.
3. **Wire the documented HTML hooks** — class names (`.t-dropdown`, `.t-modal`, `.t-success-check`, `.t-avatar`, `.t-clear`, `.t-skel`, `.t-shimmer`, `.t-tabs`, `.t-tt`, `.t-stagger`, `.t-tilt`, `.t-morph`, `.t-acc`, …) and state attributes (`data-open`, `data-state`, `data-page`, `data-origin`, `aria-selected`, `aria-expanded`, `.is-open`, `.is-closing`, `.is-error`, `.is-shaking`, `.has-value`, `.is-clearing`, `.is-pulsing`, `.is-revealed`, `.is-shown`, `.is-hiding`, `.is-hover`, `.is-tilting`).
4. **Preserve the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block.** Every snippet ships one. Removing it makes the component fail accessibility audits.
5. **For transitions that need JS** (dropdown, modal, text swap, number pop-in, page slide, success check, avatar group hover, error state shake, input clear, skeleton reveal, tabs sliding, texts reveal, card hover tilt, plus → menu morph, accordion expand), copy the small orchestration snippet from the reference file and adapt the selectors to the user's DOM. Keep the timing reads (`getComputedStyle(...)getPropertyValue("--…")`) so durations stay in sync with the `:root` values. Shimmer text and tooltip are **pure CSS** — no JS needed.

Keep the diff small: only edit the files needed to introduce the transition. Don't rename the user's existing variables, don't reformat unrelated CSS, don't pull in a motion library.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Stripping the close-state class cleanup** on dropdown/modal — without the `setTimeout` that removes `.is-closing`, the next open jumps from the closing scale instead of the resting pre-open scale.
- **Forgetting the reflow** in the text swap, number pop-in, success check replay, and error state shake — `void el.offsetWidth` (or `offsetHeight`) between class/attribute removal and re-addition is what guarantees the animation replays.
- **Animating a single container** instead of the inner pieces — for the badge, animate the dot, not the trigger; for page slide, animate the page sections, not the container.
- **Replacing `transition: …` with `transition: all`** — every snippet enumerates exact properties on purpose so unrelated style changes don't ride in for free.
- **Hardcoding the success check's `stroke-dasharray`** — the snippet ships `20` as a placeholder. Replace it with `path.getTotalLength()` rounded up by 1 for *your* path, otherwise the stroke pre-reveals or over-draws.
- **Setting `transition-timing-function` in CSS** for the avatar group hover — it has to be set inline in JS *before* the `--shift` / `--scale-active` writes so the bouncy ease-out only applies on `mouseleave`.
- **Mixing `.is-error` and `.is-shaking` into one class** for the error state shake — keeping them orthogonal is what allows the shake to replay (remove → reflow → re-add) without flickering the whole error treatment.
- **Leaving the input clear glow on `mix-blend-mode: multiply` in dark mode** — flip to `screen`, bump `--glow-opacity` to ~0.85, and paint white gradients in JS.
- **Forgetting to write the tabs pill's first position without a transition** — on first paint and resize, set `transform` + `width` with `transition: none` (then reflow + restore) or the pill animates in from `translateX(0)` / `width: 0`.
- **Tracking the pointer on the tilting element itself** for card hover tilt — bind `pointermove` to the flat outer `.t-tilt` wrapper, not `.t-tilt-card`, or the rotating edges slip under the cursor and the hover flickers.
- **Padding on the accordion grid track** — put padding on `.t-acc-panel-inner`, never on `.t-acc-panel`; padding on the `0fr` track leaves a residual height strip so the panel never fully closes.
- **Morphing the accordion chevron's `d` path** — CSS `d:` path interpolation is Chromium-only, so it never animates on mobile Safari / Firefox. Flip the chevron vertically (`transform: scaleY(-1)`) instead — it passes through a flat line at the midpoint just like the path morph and works everywhere. Keep the path symmetric about its viewBox centre and add `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` so the stroke stays constant through the flip. This is what the snippet ships.
