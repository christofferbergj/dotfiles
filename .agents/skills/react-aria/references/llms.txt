- [v1.0.0](releases/v1-0-0.md): Welcome to the last release of the year! After a year of work, we are happy to announce the GA release of React Aria Components 🎉 This component library, built on top of our React Aria hooks, provides a simpler way to craft world-class accessible components with custom styles. See our new React Aria [landing page](../.md) for all of the details, including interactive examples. To help get you started even faster, we now also have a downloadable Storybook [starter kit](../getting-started.md#storybook-starter-kits) including an example CSS theme.
- [v1.1.0](releases/v1-1-0.md): Welcome to the first release of the new year! We have had a great response to our GA release of React Aria Components. If you haven't tried it out, visit [our docs](../.md) to explore the examples. To help get you started, we have also created a few starter kits. These downloadable [starter kits](../getting-started.md#storybook-starter-kits) contain beautifully styled implementations of every available component and includes a working storybook. Available in vanilla and Tailwind CSS!
- [v1.10.0](releases/v1-10-0.md): Drop everything! Drag and drop support in React Aria Tree has been released! 🫳🎤 This supports moving items within a tree or between collection components, with full keyboard and screen reader accessibility. It's interoperable with our existing drag and drop support in components like Table and GridList, and with third party apps via native HTML APIs. Check out our [previous blog post](../blog/drag-and-drop.md) on drag and drop to learn about the interactions, and our new [Tree drag and drop documentation](../Tree.md#drag-and-drop).
- [v1.11.0](releases/v1-11-0.md): Happy summer! This release adds support for async loading and infinite scrolling, improves form integration and drag and drop interactions, and adds support for additional DOM events and attributes.
- [v1.12.0](releases/v1-12-0.md): Summer might be winding down but we're definitely not! Back with another release, we have added support for origin-aware overlay animations in [Popover](../Popover.md) and [Tooltip](../Tooltip.md), which enable scale transitions to appear as if they are emerging from the trigger. We have also advanced Autocomplete to RC, and added support for filtering GridList, Table, and TagGroup (virtual focus support is still to come). Section support in [GridList](../GridList.md#sections) has also been added as an alpha, laying the groundwork for similar support in Tree and Table.
- [v1.13.0](releases/v1-13-0.md): Happy fall! This release brings some long-awaited features, including multi-selection in [React Aria Select](../Select.md#value) and enhanced animation support across our components. For example, [Disclosure](../Disclosure.md) now provides CSS variables to easily animate expanding and collapsing. We’ve also added a new `<SelectionIndicator>` component that can be used within components that support single selection such as [Tabs](../Tabs.md) and [ToggleButtonGroup](../ToggleButtonGroup.md#animation) to animate selection changes. In addition, we have significantly improved the behavior of scrolling modals on iOS 26. Lastly, `onAction` can now be used on a [`ComboBoxItem`](../ComboBox.md#item-actions), enabling you to add a “create” option.
- [v1.14.0](releases/v1-14-0.md): Wrapping up this year with a bang and our most exciting release yet! Meet our new website. We heard your feedback and have reimagined the docs to be more concise and make greater use of interactive examples using prop controls. Code examples have been refined to highlight what matters most, and real-world app examples show how all these pieces come together. The new search experience includes image previews and category and library filtering, helping you find what you need faster. There are more component examples, new guides, AI-friendly page markdown, and MCP servers, all wrapped up in a fresh new look. 🎁 Explore the updated experience of [React Aria](react-aria:.md).
- [v1.15.0](releases/v1-15-0.md): New year, new release, and the shine hasn’t worn off from our new documentation website: we’ve already added new [Agent Skills](../ai.md#agent-skills) and improved the search experience 😍. This month’s release includes a big update to our compatibility, with DOM customization options via a [new `render` prop](../customization.md#dom-elements) for React Aria Components. This feature will help with cases such as rendering Router Link components, or for use with animation libraries. We have also fixed our most upvoted issue: we now constrain dates on blur instead of as you type, allowing more input flexibility and greatly improving the user experience of our date fields.
- [v1.2.0](releases/v1-2-0.md): We have a huge release today! Its a GA bonanza 🎊 – [Submenu](../Menu.md#submenus), [unavailable menu items](s2:v3/Menu.md#unavailable-items), [DropZone](../DropZone.md) and [FileTrigger](../FileTrigger.md) components are now in GA. Check our [blog post](react-aria:blog/creating-a-pointer-friendly-submenu-experience.md) on the intricacies of the submenu interactions and how we handled them.
- [v1.3.0](releases/v1-3-0.md): For this summer release, we have been busy working on improving virtualization in many of our Spectrum components including TableView, ListView, and ListBox. We have significantly reduced the complexity of our implementation, resulting in smaller bundle size, better performance, and improved stability. In our testing, this resulted in 14x faster per-frame render times on large tables due to better reuse of DOM nodes as you scroll. We are also working on bringing virtualization support to React Aria Components, which is available as an unstable API in this version.
- [v1.4.0](releases/v1-4-0.md): Happy fall! 🍁 We're excited to announce that our color picker components are now generally available! This includes [ColorPicker](../ColorPicker.md), [ColorArea](../ColorArea.md), [ColorField](../ColorField.md), [ColorSlider](../ColorSlider.md), [ColorSwatch](../ColorSwatch.md), [ColorSwatchPicker](../ColorSwatchPicker.md), and [ColorWheel](../ColorWheel.md). These enable you to build fully customizable color pickers, including accessible color descriptions for screen reader support.
- [v1.5.0](releases/v1-5-0.md): We're excited to announce that our Disclosure components are now generally available! This includes [Disclosure](../Disclosure.md) and [DisclosureGroup](../DisclosureGroup.md) in React Aria. These components now also use the `hidden="until-found"` API currently supported in Chrome to enable searching collapsed content with ctrl + F.
- [v1.6.0](releases/v1-6-0.md): Happy New Year! Our first release of 2025 includes a new [firstDayOfWeek](../Calendar.md#display-options) prop for our calendar and date picker components, support for [CSS transitions](../styling.md#animation) in our overlay components, a new [Autocomplete](../Autocomplete.md) component in alpha, and a new [React Aria test utils](../testing.md#react-aria-test-utils) package.
- [v1.7.0](releases/v1-7-0.md): Buckle in because this is a big one! In this React Aria release, we’re excited to announce three new components: [Toast](../Toast.md), [Tree](../Tree.md), and [Virtualizer](../Virtualizer.md). In addition, we have improved [Autocomplete](../Autocomplete.md) to enable UI patterns like [Searchable Menus](../Menu.md#autocomplete), [Searchable Selects](../Select.md#autocomplete), and [Command Palettes](../Autocomplete.md), added support for custom [Menu](../Menu.md#custom-trigger), [Popover](../Popover.md#custom-trigger), and [Tooltip](../Tooltip.md#custom-trigger) triggers, introduced `colSpan` support in Table, and upgraded to Tailwind CSS v4. Last but not least, we have a major refactor of [usePress](../usePress.md), which fixes many longstanding issues and improves compatibility with third party libraries.
- [v1.8.0](releases/v1-8-0.md): In today's release, we are excited to announce custom calendar support in React Aria Components! This feature allows you to create your own calendar that implements custom business logic, such as a [4-5-4 fiscal calendar](https://nrf.com/resources/4-5-4-calendar), either by extending an existing Calendar implementation or building from scratch. Please see the [React Aria docs](../Calendar.md#custom-calendar-systems) for an example implementation. A special shout out to [@ToyWalrus](https://github.com/ToyWalrus) for all the hard work that went into this contribution!
- [v1.9.0](releases/v1-9-0.md): This release includes a range of enhancements and fixes such as improved keyboard accessibility in TagGroup and increased stability for dynamic table updates.
